Additional notes:

Not done styling yet, but completely functional.
In index.html I have a nav-bar commented out because i haven't finished styling it yet.
I added additional conditional code in the end of index.html, I found it easier to use jQuery but I didn't modify the existing code which is native JavaScript, so it might look inconsistent.
I thought it looked better for the skills to be in its own section and not in the header, but I still left it in the bio object.
Most of the css that I modified I added to the end of the file even if technically it would belong elsewhere.
